    Well you only need the light when it's burning low
    Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
    Only know you love her when you let her go
    Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
    Only hate the road when you're missing home
    Only know you love her when you let her go<br><br>
    And you let her go
    Staring at the bottom of your glass
    Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
    But dreams come slow and they go so fast
    You see her when you close your eyes
    Maybe one day you'll understand why
    Everything you touch surely dies<br><br>
    But you only need the light when it's burning low
    Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
    Only know you love her when you let her go
    Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
    Only hate the road when you're missing home
    Only know you love her when you let her go<br><br>
    Staring at the ceiling in the dark
    Same old empty feeling in your heart
    'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
    Well you see her when you fall asleep
    But never to touch and never to keep<br><br>
    'Cause you loved her too much and you dive too deep
    Well you only need the light when it's burning low
    Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
    Only know you love her when you let her go
    Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
    Only hate the road when you're missing home
    Only know you love her when you let her go<br><br>
    And you let her go
    Oh oh oh no
    And you let her go
    Oh oh oh no
    Well you let her go<br><br>
    'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
    Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
    Only know you love her when you let her go
    Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
    Only hate the road when you're missing home
    Only know you love her when you let her go<br><br>
    'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
    Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
    Only know you love her when you let her go
    Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
    Only hate the road when you're missing home
    Only know you love her when you let her go
    And you let her go
